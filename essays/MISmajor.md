Going into college, I was interested in business, but more specifically the technology side of business. I wanted to know more about information systems and their applications in a business context. I am very aware of the phrase "technology is the future" and I am determined to stay caught up with the applications of technology in business. Additionally, I would like to build a solid base for myself in terms of my technical knowledge, that I will undoubtedly be able to use in the future, no matter what career I eventually end up pursuing. 

I chose to major in Management Information Systems because I knew that it would help me achieve all of these things. I also want to build hard skills, such as basic programming knowledge and problem solving.
