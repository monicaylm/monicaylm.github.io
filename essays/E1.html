  <p>For Browser History WOD 1, I felt that it was not too difficult to follow the directions the first time I did a run-through. However, I did have to consult the readings about HTML because I wasn’t that familiar with the syntax. This made me take a while to finish, around 20-25 minutes for the first run-through. I did a second run-through while timing myself but I forgot some of the syntax so I ended up restarting to review the syntax. I did my third run-through with the screen recording in about 12 minutes. I was able to do it so fast because I remembered from previous attempts For this WOD, I didn’t have to consult the screencast, but it was just a matter of remembering the HTML for inserting links, images, etc.</p>

<p>WOD 2 was a bit more challenging for me because I found myself needing to review the CSS syntax. I also initially forgot to link the css page to the html page so I spent a while struggling. Also had to consult the screen cast for assistance because I didn’t know how to do one part of it. After screen recording a couple of attempts I eventually managed to get my completion time under the RX. I enjoyed this WOD because it was a good opportunity to get hands-on learning with CSS and apply all the knowledge from the readings to designing a webpage.</p>

<p>WOD 3, although short, was one that I struggled with the most in terms of figuring out the right code to put in to edit the webpage. After looking at the instructions, I went to watch the screencast and see what needed to be done. Then I started a timer and tried to do it myself. This took a while because I had to familiarize myself with each of the commands and what they did, and also go back to review the readings. I think for WOD 3 especially I should have taken a little longer to try and figure it out on my own before skipping straight to the screencast but I was a little pressed for time.</p>

<p>Overall, my advice for the WODs is to try them first before watching the screencast so that you can understand what the instructions are asking you to do. I would also run through it until you feel that you are comfortable enough to properly complete the run through while screen recording so that you are at RX or AV.</p>
