For Browser History WOD 1, I felt that it was not too difficult to follow the directions the first time I did a run-through. However, I did have to consult the readings about HTML because I wasn’t that familiar with the syntax. This made me take a while to finish, around 20-25 minutes for the first run-through. I did a second run-through while timing myself but I forgot some of the syntax so I ended up restarting to review the syntax. I did my third run-through with the screen recording in about 12 minutes. I was able to do it so fast because I remembered from previous attempts For this WOD, I didn’t have to consult the screencast, but it was just a matter of remembering the HTML for inserting links, images, etc. 

WOD 2 was a bit more challenging for me because I found myself needing to review the CSS syntax. I also initially forgot to link the css page to the html page so I spent a while struggling. Also had to consult the screen cast for assistance because I didn’t know how to do one part of it. After screen recording a couple of attempts I eventually managed to get my completion time under the RX. I enjoyed this WOD because it was a good opportunity to get hands-on learning with CSS and apply all the knowledge from the readings to designing a webpage.

WOD 3, although short, was one that I struggled with the most in terms of figuring out the right code to put in to edit the webpage. After looking at the instructions, I went to watch the screencast and see what needed to be done. Then I started a timer and tried to do it myself. This took a while because I had to familiarize myself with each of the commands and what they did, and also go back to review the readings. I think for WOD 3 especially I should have taken a little longer to try and figure it out on my own before skipping straight to the screencast but I was a little pressed for time. 

Overall, my advice for the WODs is to try them first before watching the screencast so that you can understand what the instructions are asking you to do. I would also run through it until you feel that you are comfortable enough to properly complete the run through while screen recording so that you are at RX or AV.
